# Ai-Based-Iot-IDS
AI-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for IoT networks, using machine learning to detect attacks like DoS, MITM, and Data Injection. The system simulates attacks, classifies packets, and displays real-time results on an interactive Flask web interface with enhanced visualization and detection accuracy.
