An AI-powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed specifically for IoT networks to detect and classify security threats in real-time. The system uses machine learning to identify attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS), Man-in-the-Middle (MITM), and Data Injection attacks.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI-Based-IoT-IDS.git
   cd AI-Based-IoT-IDS
````

2. **Install required dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the system**

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the dashboard**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to view the system's dashboard.

## 🛠️ Features

* Real-time attack detection using machine learning
* Web-based interface built with Flask
* Accurate classification of DoS, MITM, and Data Injection attacks

## 📊 Accuracy

The system achieves an accuracy of **98.5%** in detecting and classifying attacks.
